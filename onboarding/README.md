# Onboarding

Onboarding documenation will guide a new hire from noob to contributing hero as quickly as possible.

We have broken this section down by role and cover everything from access, equipment and education.

The relevant roles are [reflected as teams in the GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/NoXX-Technologies/teams) and explained below.

Please do not complain about not understanding the tech stack if you have not read and understand the education material listed below.

To be clear, we are not requiring frontend developers to educate themselves on backend material and vice versa. In fact, if you're not a backend developer, you should not be concerned with how the backend works (and vice versa).

## Frontend Developers
Frontend Developers work primarily in React to build customer-facing clients that connect to backend technologies
## Backend Developers
Backend Developers create microservices that power, create, format and serve data to numerous front-end clients.

## Platform Developers
Platform Developers are NoOps engineers who automate Operations into PaaS and FaaS that host the services and clients built by the backend and frontend developers. This role also creates CI/CD pipelines as well as local development setups. Essentially, the Platform Developers' job is to make sure the Frontend Developers and Backend Developers only need to worry about creating application business logic.
