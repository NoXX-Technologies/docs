# Docs

Welcome to NOXX's collection of documentation!

Who ever thought documentation could be this fun, right?

Anyway, the main page here acts as an index into specific levels of documentation.

************ STOP *****************

Is something missing or off?

Does something not work like the documentation says it should?

Does something not make sense?

Don't keep going! Fix/add it! Or contact Cody and he'll fix/add it!
